## Overview

Create <b>Desktop Application</b> driven by <b>Python</b> to collect user data and store in local database.</br>

## App Modifications

### Tkinter GUI

We used the <b>Tkinter</b> standard interface to create the <b>GUI</b> for the user to interact with when running the application.

The [(`app.py`)](app.py) <b>Python</b> file must be run to add, delete, or modify customers. This can be done as shown below.

We can also query the database and view information for all individuals in some specified order.

### Further Exploration

We are considering implementing <b>Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</b> principles to add employee functionality to the company, where individuals are provided salaries, hired and fired on demand. This will allow us to simulate an income flow for the **Electrical Company**.
