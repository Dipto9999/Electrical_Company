## Overview

Create <b>Desktop Application</b> driven by <b>Python</b> to collect user data and store in local database.</br>

## App Modification

### Graphical User Interface

We used the <b>Tkinter</b> standard interface to create the <b>GUI</b> for the user to interact with when running the application.

### Further Exploration

We are considering implementing <b>Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</b> principles to add employee functionality to the company, where individuals are provided salaries, hired and fired on demand. This will allow us to simulate an income flow for the **Electrical Company**.
